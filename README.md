# Videos to Books

**Work in Progress**

A web application to create books from video transcripts.

We are working with the current tools:
- YouTube's transcript API to get video text
- OpenAI/ChatGPT API to improve video text and create a book
- Pandoc to generate EPUB and PDF.

The languages currently supported are English and Portuguese.
